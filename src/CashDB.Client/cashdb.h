/* A coin, identified by its outpoint, and asssociated to two blocks which 
  represent the events in its lifecycle, namely its production and consumption.

  A coin is first produced, and thus enters the UTXO dataset. This coin can
  later be spent. The strict UTXO includes only the produced-but-not-spent
  yet coins.
 
  production: identifies the block where the output
              has been produced (zero if not).

  consumption: identifies the block where the the output
              has been consumed (zero if not).

  satoshis: the monetary amount associated to the coin.

  nLockTime: parameter to claim the coins (actually duplicated among all
		coins originating from the same transaction).

  script_offset:
  script_length:
		The script is intended to be externally stored in a buffer provided 
		on the  side. Indices represents the data segment  within this buffer 
		associated to the script of the coin. When the coin is found, the
		'script_length' is returned. However, if 'CASHDB_COIN_STATUS_STORAGE_TOO_SHORT'
		then, no corresponding script can be loaded from 'storage'. The script
		length is returned however, to facilitate choosing an adequate size for
		the storage during a later 'get_coins' attempt.

  flags: misc flags intended for persistence within the UTXO set.

  status: return code at the coin-level (nb: populated through side-effect
        when 'cashdb_utxo_set_coins()' is called).

  The script is the binary data attached to a transaction output. CashDB has no
  specific affinity to the Bitcoin scripting system, hence the script is treated
  as a binary payload without any attempt at inspecting this data. The intent is
  to decouple the UTXO API from the cryptographic validation as much as possible.

   Validation rules: 

   - Submitting a `coin_t` that is identical to the current state of the
     outpoint on the CashDB instance is always valid (by idempotence).

   - The `coin_t.production` and `coin_t.consumption` represent production or 
     spending events for the transaction output in the chain leading up 
     to `block`. Those events are exclusive, and one of the must be
	 zero at every one.

     When an event can be changed, the corresponding field may only be set to 
     `block` (to indicate that the event occurred in the current block) or to
     zero (to undo a previous write that set the field to `block`, thereby
     "deleting" the event).
     
   - If `coin_t.production` is non zero, then `coin_t.consumption` must be zero, and
     the `coin_t.script.length` must be greater than zero.

   - If `coin_t.consumption` is non zero, then `coin_t.production` must be zero, and
     the `coin_t.script.length` must be zero as well. The values of `coin_t.satoshi`
	 and `coin_t.nLockTime` must be zero.

   - The `coin_t.satoshi`, `coin_t.nLockTime` and the content of `coin_t.script` 
     can never be changed once set (and there is no reasonable situation where they 
     would need to be changed). The will be the same for all chains in CashDB
     (not just for the chain leading up to `block`). 

   This method is IDEMPOTENT.
